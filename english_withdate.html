  <div style="text-align:justify;">
    <p>My name is Mark Brand.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="text-align:justify;">
    <p>
      I am an experienced and certified freelance scrum product owner with a passion to drive digital business capabilities forward. In collaboration with full-stack DevOps teams, designers and analysts, I create awesome digital user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a senior product owner, I have a proven track record in increasing the profitability (> 1 million EBIT contribution) of high-traffic websites by initiating and executing online product development projects in complex organizational and online environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach is characterized by translating the organizational strategy into an online product vision and developing user-friendly online products that measurably contribute to the set goals step-by-step.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a strong communicator (Executive Board level) and negotiator with a keen eye for the challenges, needs and concerns of customers, team members and management. Thanks to my seniority, I am able to adopt my leadership style to the situation and context of the moment. Often in the style of visionary who takes the lead and sets clear priorities, if possible, more in the role of servant leader and coach. Forging high-performing teams together with the scrum master gives me a lot of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My extensive experience in applying Agile principles â€“ releasing a minimum viable product to real users fast and then continuously improving based on data and user feedback - allows me to add value for your customers and your organization without wasting valuable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of July 1, 2018 I am available to help you accelerate the digital transformation of your organization.
